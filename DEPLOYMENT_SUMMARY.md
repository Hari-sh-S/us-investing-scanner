## 🚀 Quick Start - 3 Steps to Deploy

### Option A: Manual Deployment (Recommended for first-timers)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `investing-scanner`
3. **Don't** initialize with README
4. Click **Create repository**

#### Step 2: Push Your Code
Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\haris\OneDrive\Project Fetch\claude investing"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/investing-scanner.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!**

#### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **New app**
4. Select your repository: `investing-scanner`
5. Main file: `app.py`
6. Click **Deploy**

---

### Option B: Automated Script

Run the automated setup script:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\haris\OneDrive\Project Fetch\claude investing"
.\deploy_to_github.ps1
```

This will prompt you for:
- GitHub username
- Repository name

Then it will automatically push your code to GitHub!

After that, follow Step 3 from Option A above.

## 🔑 Important Notes

### Data Persistence
⚠️ **Streamlit Cloud has ephemeral storage**  
- Data cache will reset on app restart
- Users will need to download data again after app sleeps
- Consider implementing:
  - Cloud storage (S3, GCS) for persistent cache
  - Smaller default universes for faster initial load

### Free Tier Limitations
- **1 GB RAM** - Enough for most backtests
- **1 CPU core** - May be slow for large universes
- **App sleeps** after inactivity (wakes on visit)

### Optimization Tips
1. Use smaller date ranges by default
2. Limit universe size for demo
3. Cache indicator calculations
4. Consider pagination for large trade histories
